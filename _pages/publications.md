Comparing Acute IOP-Induced Lamina Cribrosa Deformations Premortem and Postmortem.

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"><b>Introduction: </b> Lamina cribrosa (LC) deformations caused by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) are believed to contribute to glaucomatous neuropathy and have therefore been extensively studied, in many conditions, from in vivo to ex vivo. We compare acute IOP-induced global and local LC deformations immediately before (premortem) and after (postmortem) sacrifice by exsanguination.</span>
- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"><b>Methods:</b> The optic nerve heads of three healthy monkeys 12 to 15 years old were imaged with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography under controlled IOP premortem and postmortem. Volume scans were acquired at baseline IOP (8–10 mm Hg) and at 15, 30, and 40 mm Hg IOP. A digital volume correlation technique was used to determine the IOP-induced three-dimensional LC deformations (strains) in regions visible premortem and postmortem. </span>
- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"><b>Results:</b> Both conditions exhibited similar nonlinear relationships between IOP increases and LC deformations. Median effective and shear strains were, on average, over all eyes and pressures, smaller postmortem than premortem, by 14% and 11%, respectively (P's< 0.001). Locally, however, the differences in LC deformation between conditions were variable. Some regions were subjected premortem to triple the strains observed postmortem, and others suffered smaller deformations premortem than postmortem. </span>
 - <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"><b>Conclusions:</b> Increasing IOP acutely caused nonlinear LC deformations with an overall smaller effect postmortem than premortem. Locally, deformations premortem and postmortem were sometimes substantially different. We suggest that the differences may be due to weakened mechanical support.</span>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"> <b>Introduction: </b> Axial rasters of the optic nerve from a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography(SD-OCT) [Cirrus 5000. Zeiss Meditch] were used to analyze the shape of the peripapillary basement membrane-layer (ppBM-layer) in 20 confirmed cases of ONHD. We compared registered images obtained two eye positions: 10-15° in adduction and 30-40° degrees in abduction. Geometric Morphometrics was used to analyze the shape of the ppBM-layer defined by placing 10 equidistant landmarks extending 2500 microns on both sides of the basement membrane opening. We also adapted an image strain tracking technique to measure regional intrapapillary strains in six of our patients. Using manually placed “nodes” on the reference image (in adduction), an iterative, block-matching algorithm is used to determine local displacements between the reference and its paired image in abduction. Displacement vectors were used to calculate the mean shear and effective strain(%change) </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> <b>Introduction: </b> Kalman filter (KF) and extended Kalman Filters (EKF) have been used to develop a 70% Lumen Maintenance Life Prediction Model for LEDs used in SSL luminaires. Ten-thousand-hour LM-80 test data for various LEDs have been used for model development. System state at each future time has been computed based on the state space at preceding time step, system dynamics matrix, control vector, control matrix, measurement matrix, measured vector, process noise, and measurement noise. The future state of the lumen depreciation has been estimated based on a second-order Kalman Filter model and a Bayesian Framework. The measured state variable has been related to the underlying damage using physics-based models. Life prediction of L70 life for the LEDs used in SSL luminaires from KF- and EKF-based models have been compared with the TM-21 model predictions and experimental data. </b>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"> <b>Introduction:</b> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence performed by designed algorithms. Recently, there are many advancements in the AI field that benefited by the improvements in computational power from the hardware. Meanwhile, there is easy access and availability of data from various platforms. AI technologies with data science can help solve many industrial problems like tracking Solid-state Lighting (SSL) system degradation, classifying LED failures, and predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for the system. The modern AI technologies and fields include Deep Learning (DL) and Computer Vision (CV). Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is the fundamental network that can be easily adapted to the imaging system for material degradation analysis in the LEDs. In this chapter, firstly, it introduces representative supervised learning algorithms for LED degradation monitoring.</span>
