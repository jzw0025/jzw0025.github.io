- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> I conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of <b>in-situ mechanics</b> and <b>3D computer vision</b>, with a primary focus on <b>computational medical images</b> and the <b>3D deformation</b> of objects subjected to diverse mechanical tests, such as mechanical failure tests, thermomechanical tests, and in-vivo pressure tests. My research aims to <b>nondestructively</b> measure deformation using various imaging modalities, including <b>X-ray micro-CT (uCT)</b>, <b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</b>, <b>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</b>, and <b>3D fluorescent confocal microscopy</b>. The overarching objective of my work is to quantify deformation-induced degradations, damages, remodeling, and diseases, elucidating the relationship between structural changes and functional outcomes, such as the impact of lamina cribrosa deformations on neural tissue loss leading to glaucoma. In the context of my dissertation, I extensively employ the <b>Digital Volume Correlation (DVC)</b> technique to investigate the in-situ deformation of electronics under diverse conditions, including thermal shock and three-point bending. This involves studying phenomena such as LEDs chip deformation during operation and solder joint deformation of flip chips in mechanical bending tests. A key focus of my research is understanding the correlation between strain distribution and failure modes in electronic components.  </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> The three main areas of my research can be delineated as follows: </span> 
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> <b>Glaucoma Prediction and Prevention from Tissue Mechanics:</b> I delve into the mechanics of tissues to predict and prevent glaucoma, exploring how deformations in structures like the lamina cribrosa contribute to the loss of neural tissue. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of tissue degenerations and facilitates early intervention strategies. </p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> <b>Computational Mechanics of Flexible Electronics:</b> My research investigates the computational mechanics of flexible electronics, specifically addressing the deformation and reliability of electronic components under various conditions. This encompasses the study of LEDs chip deformation during operation and solder joint deformation in mechanical bending tests, shedding light on the behavior of flexible electronic systems.</p> 

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"><b>Electronics Reliability and Prognostic Health Management(PHM):</b> I contribute to the field of electronics reliability and Prognostic Health Management by employing the Digital Volume Correlation technique to analyze strain distribution and failure modes in electronic components. This research aids in developing strategies for predicting and managing the health of electronic systems.</p> 

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> In short, my research not only bridges the gap between <b>in-situ mechanics</b> and <b>3D computer vision</b> but also addresses critical issues in medical and electronic domains. Looking ahead, my future research interests lie in expanding these investigations and exploring new avenues at the forefront of in-situ mechanics, computational imaging, and their applications in diverse fields.</span>
