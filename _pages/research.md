- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> I conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of <b>in-situ mechanics</b> and <b>3D computer vision</b>, with a primary focus on <b>computational medical images</b> and the <b>3D deformation</b> of objects subjected to diverse mechanical tests, such as mechanical failure tests, thermomechanical tests, and in-vivo pressure tests. My research aims to <b>nondestructively</b> measure deformation using various imaging modalities, including <b>X-ray micro-CT (uCT)</b>, <b>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</b>, <b>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</b>, and <b>3D fluorescent confocal microscopy</b>. The overarching objective of my work is to quantify deformation-induced degradations, damages, remodeling, and diseases, elucidating the relationship between structural changes and functional outcomes, such as the impact of lamina cribrosa deformations on neural tissue loss leading to glaucoma. In the context of my dissertation, I extensively employ the <b>Digital Volume Correlation (DVC)</b> technique to investigate the in-situ deformation of electronics under diverse conditions, including thermal shock and three-point bending. This involves studying phenomena such as LEDs chip deformation during operation and solder joint deformation of flip chips in mechanical bending tests. A key focus of my research is understanding the correlation between strain distribution and failure modes in electronic components.  </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> The three main areas of my research can be delineated as follows: </span> 
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> <b>Glaucoma Prediction and Prevention from Tissue Mechanics:</b> I delve into the mechanics of tissues to predict and prevent glaucoma, exploring how deformations in structures like the lamina cribrosa contribute to the loss of neural tissue. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of tissue degenerations and facilitates early intervention strategies. </p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> Glaucoma, recognized as the second leading cause of global blindness by the World Health Organization (WHO), remains enigmatic in its underlying mechanisms. A pivotal factor in the onset of glaucoma is the alteration in intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP instigates structural damage to the Optic Nerve Head (ONH) through the significant deformation of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC). The LC, responsible for providing structural support to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and blood vessels upon their entry into the eye, undergoes substantial deformation that can lead to neural tissue damage. Prior research has indicated that the deformed LC strains RGC axons and blood vessels, causing remote damage to retinal tissues and triggering remodeling of the connective tissue microarchitecture within the LC.</p> 

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> My primary objective is to quantify in-vivo LC deformations to unravel the biomechanical intricacies of glaucoma. Specifically, this research aims to achieve two key goals: first, to analyze LC deformations in response to changes in IOP, and second, to compare these deformations between individuals with glaucoma and healthy subjects. Employing OCT imaging, I will capture high-resolution, in-vivo ONH images under controlled pressure conditions. The subsequent computation of deformations will be facilitated through a sophisticated 3D image-based registration technique.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> Central to this research is the hypothesis that in-vivo LC deformations escalate with increasing IOP levels, and these deformations are more pronounced in glaucoma patients compared to their healthy counterparts. The quantification of differences between glaucomatous and healthy conditions is imperative for providing clinicians with a deeper understanding of the deformation mechanisms associated with varying IOP.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> Looking forward, the research trajectory involves an extensive analysis of clinical data from human subjects, adapting the tools for seamless clinical translation. The potential funding avenue through NIH further underscores the commitment to advancing this research into practical applications. Furthermore, the versatility of the demonstrated technique extends beyond LC deformations; it can be seamlessly adapted to other tissues or regions within the eye, such as the trabecular meshwork, cornea, retinal fiber layer, and sclera. This adaptability enables the exploration and computation of in-vivo mechanical properties for a comprehensive understanding of ocular biomechanics.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"> <b>Computational Mechanics of Flexible Electronics:</b> My research investigates the computational mechanics of flexible electronics, specifically addressing the deformation and reliability of electronic components under various conditions. This encompasses the study of LEDs chip deformation during operation and solder joint deformation in mechanical bending tests, shedding light on the behavior of flexible electronic systems.</p> 

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em"><b>Electronics Reliability and Prognostic Health Management(PHM):</b> I contribute to the field of electronics reliability and Prognostic Health Management by employing the Digital Volume Correlation technique to analyze strain distribution and failure modes in electronic components. This research aids in developing strategies for predicting and managing the health of electronic systems.</p> 

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> In short, my research not only bridges the gap between <b>in-situ mechanics</b> and <b>3D computer vision</b> but also addresses critical issues in medical and electronic domains. Looking ahead, my future research interests lie in expanding these investigations and exploring new avenues at the forefront of in-situ mechanics, computational imaging, and their applications in diverse fields.</p>
