<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> Granted Patents </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> <b>U.S. Patent US17/515,230, “Deep Learning Based Text Correction Method and Apparatus”, 2024 </b> [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303901A1/en) </span> <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"> - A text correction method and apparatus can take advantage of a greatly reduced number of error-ground truth pairs to train a deep learning model. To generate these error-ground truth pairs, different characters in a ground truth word are replaced with a symbol, not appearing in any ground truth words, to generate error words which are paired with that ground truth word to provide error-ground truth word pairs. This process may be repeated for all ground truth words for which training is to be performed. In embodiments, pairs of characters in a ground truth word may be replaced with a symbol to generate the error words which are paired with that ground truth word to provide error-ground truth word pairs. Again, this process may be repeated for all ground truth words for which training is to be performed. </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> <b>U.S. Patent US12008826, “Method and apparatus for customized deep learning-based text correction”, 2024 </b> [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303901A1/en) </span> <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"> -  A text correction engine meets different and changing end user requirements, with the ability to change a desired output by providing sufficient amounts of data, and by finetuning the appropriate text correction engine at the point of origin of the data. It is possible to retain confidentiality of data by retraining the base deep learning model at the base deep learning model's point of origin, to improve the base deep learning model's performance, making the base deep learning model more accurate for different contexts. Separate training of an end user model, leaving the base deep learning model intact, streamlines end user model training, and highlights desirable changes in the base deep learning model for further training or retraining.</span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> <b>U.S. Patent US11748341, “Method, apparatus, and system for form auto-registration using virtual table generation and association”, 2024 </b> [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303901A1/en) </span> <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"> - In different kinds of forms with incomplete lines, or with different color cells in lieu of lines, virtually completing or providing the lines enables formation of tables from which keywords and content in the forms may be identified. Where a form may have one or more such tables, as can be the case with forms with irregular formats, multiple tables may be identified, to facilitate identification of keywords and content in each such table. In embodiments, deep learning techniques may be applied. Cost analysis involving minimum distances between keywords and content may be performed, with the cost analysis also facilitating formation of a keyword dictionary and a content dictionary.</span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"><b>U.S. Patent, US11270146B2, “Text Location Method and Apparatus”, Feb. 2022 [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303901A1/en)</b> </span>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> Aspects of the present invention provide a new text location technique, which can be applied to general handwriting detection at a variety of levels, including characters, words, and sentences. The inventive technique is efficient in training deep learning systems to locate text. The technique works for different languages, for text in different orientations, and for overlapping text. In one aspect, the technique's ability to separate overlapping text also makes the technique useful in application to overlapping objects. Embodiments take advantage of a so-called skyline appearance that text tends to have. Recognizing a skyline appearance for text can facilitate the proper identification of bounding boxes for the text. Even in the case of overlapping text, discernment of a skyline appearance for words can help with the proper identification of bounding boxes for each of the overlapping text words/phrases, thereby facilitating the separation of the text for purposes of recognition. </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"><b>U.S. Patent, US10764471B1, “Customized Grayscale Conversion in Color Form Processing for Text Recognition in OCR”, September 2019 [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303890A1/en)</b> </span>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> In a color to grayscale image conversion particularly method suitable for processing color document images such as forms, the color image is analyzed to determined which of the red, green and blue channels are the most dominant, second most dominant, and least dominant channels, based on the amount of information contained in each channel. Then, coefficients are assigned to the three channels, where the coefficient for the most dominant channel is smaller than the coefficient for the second most dominant color channel, which is in turn smaller than the coefficient for the least dominant color channel. The grayscale pixel value is then calculated using a linear combination of the red, green and blue pixel values weighted by their assigned coefficients. In one example, the ratio of the coefficients for the least dominant, the second most dominant and the most dominant channels is 10:3:1. </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"><b>U.S. Patent US11354940B2, “Method and Apparatus for Foreground Geometry and Topology Based Face Anti-spoofing”, March 2020 [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303890A1/en)</b></span>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;">A method and system to detect visual spoofing of a process of authenticating a person's identity employs computer vision techniques to define characteristics of different kinds of spoofing. Embodiments identify a foreground object within an image and by examining positions and/or orientations of that foreground object within the image, determine whether the presentation of the foreground object is an attempt to spoof the authentication process.</span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"><b>U.S. Patent US11537605B2, Method, apparatus, and system for auto-registration of nested tables from unstructured cell association for table-based documentation, Dec. 2022 [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303890A1/en)</b></span>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;">In some forms containing keywords and content, there may be nested levels of keywords, also referred to as a hierarchy. Content in the forms may be associated with one or more keywords in one or more of the nested levels, or in the hierarchy. Identifying keywords in adjacent cells in a table (with a nested keyword being either to the right of or below another keyword) enables distinguishing between keywords and content in filled forms, and enables correct association of content with respective keywords. </span>
