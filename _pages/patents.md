#### <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> U.S Patents </span> 

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> Granted Patents </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> <b>U.S. Patent US17/515,230, “Deep Learning Based Text Correction Method and Apparatus”, 2024 </b> [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303901A1/en) </span> <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em; line-height:0.8"> - A text correction method and apparatus can take advantage of a greatly reduced number of error-ground truth pairs to train a deep learning model. To generate these error-ground truth pairs, different characters in a ground truth word are replaced with a symbol, not appearing in any ground truth words, to generate error words which are paired with that ground truth word to provide error-ground truth word pairs. This process may be repeated for all ground truth words for which training is to be performed. In embodiments, pairs of characters in a ground truth word may be replaced with a symbol to generate the error words which are paired with that ground truth word to provide error-ground truth word pairs. Again, this process may be repeated for all ground truth words for which training is to be performed. </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;">U.S. Patent, B51387US01 “Text Location Method and Apparatus”, Feb. 2022 [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303901A1/en) </span>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> Aspects of the present invention provide a new text location technique, which can be applied to general handwriting detection at a variety of levels, including characters, words, and sentences. The inventive technique is efficient in training deep learning systems to locate text. The technique works for different languages, for text in different orientations, and for overlapping text. In one aspect, the technique's ability to separate overlapping text also makes the technique useful in application to overlapping objects. Embodiments take advantage of a so-called skyline appearance that text tends to have. Recognizing a skyline appearance for text can facilitate the proper identification of bounding boxes for the text. Even in the case of overlapping text, discernment of a skyline appearance for words can help with the proper identification of bounding boxes for each of the overlapping text words/phrases, thereby facilitating the separation of the text for purposes of recognition. </span>
