#### <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> U.S Patents and Applications </span> 
- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;">U.S. Patent, B51387US01 “Text Location Method and Apparatus”, Feb. 2022 [[LINK]](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210303901A1/en) </span>

<br> Aspects of the present invention provide a new text location technique, which can be applied to general handwriting detection at a variety of levels, including characters, words, and sentences. The inventive technique is efficient in training deep learning systems to locate text. The technique works for different languages, for text in different orientations, and for overlapping text. In one aspect, the technique's ability to separate overlapping text also makes the technique useful in application to overlapping objects. Embodiments take advantage of a so-called skyline appearance that text tends to have. Recognizing a skyline appearance for text can facilitate the proper identification of bounding boxes for the text. Even in the case of overlapping text, discernment of a skyline appearance for words can help with the proper identification of bounding boxes for each of the overlapping text words/phrases, thereby facilitating the separation of the text for purposes of recognition. <br/>
